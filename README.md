ofxDomemaster
=============

An openFrameworks addon for creating domemasters. A domemaster is the standard format for projection within digital dome theatres. Simply put it is a square composition with a circular mask and fisheye distortion.

This addon uses a multi-camera technique to generate a 5-sided cube map and renders each view to pregenerated meshes for spherical distortion. A circular image mask overlays the fisheye render to create a circular composition.

Use of this addon requires that you copy the domemaster folder located within the example project's bin folder to your project.
